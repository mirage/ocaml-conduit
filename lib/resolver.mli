    TLS/SSL-encrypted or not (e.g. for [https]).  *)

    concrete {{!endp}endpoints} that stream connections can be
    established with. *)

      defined via the {!IO} module type *)

  (** A service function maps the string (such as [http] or [ftp]) from
      a URI scheme into a {{!svc}service} description that includes
      enough metadata about the service to subsequently {{!rewrite_fn}resolve}
      it into an {{!endp}endpoint}. *)

  (** [init ?service ?rewrites] will initialize the resolver and return
      a state handler.  The {{!service_fn}service} argument should
      contain the system-specific resolution mechanism for URI schemas.

      The [rewrites] argument can optionally override a subset of the
      URI domain name with the given {!rewrite_fn} to permit custom
      resolution rules.  For example, a rewrite rule for ".xen" would
      let the rewrite function resolve hostnames such as "foo.xen"
      into a shared memory channel for the "foo" virtual machine. *)

      resolve a hostname with [t]. *)

      [uri] into a concrete endpoint.  Any [rewrites] that are passed
      in will be overlayed on the existing rules within the [t]
      resolver, but not otherwise modify it. *)
