(** Resolve URIs to endpoints using Unix system calls *)

(** {2 Prebuilt resolvers} *)

(** Use the Unix system name resolver via [getaddrinfo] and
    [getservbyname] *)
val system : Conduit_lwt.Resolver.t

(** [static hosts] constructs a resolver that looks up any resolution
    requests from the static [hosts] hashtable instead of using the
    system resolver. *)
val static : (string, Conduit.endp) Hashtbl.t -> Conduit_lwt.Resolver.t

(** {2 Rewrite and service functions}
    These can be used to assemble your own resolvers if the
    prebuilt ones are not quite what you need. *)

(** Perform service lookup using [getservbyname] *)
val system_service : string -> Conduit_lwt.Resolver.svc option Lwt.t

(** Perform service lookup using the builtin {!Uri_services} module *)
val static_service : string -> Conduit_lwt.Resolver.svc option Lwt.t

(** Rewrite function that uses the {!system_service} and {!static_service}
    to resolve hosts *)
val system_resolver : Conduit_lwt.Resolver.rewrite_fn

(** {2 Debugging Hooks} *)

(** If [debug] is true, the builtin resolvers will output their
    resolution responses via the {!debug_print} function.  The default
    value of [debug] is true if the [CONDUIT_DEBUG] environment variable
    is set, and false otherwise. *)
val debug : bool ref

(** [debug_print] is called by the {!debug} functions to output the
    results of resolution.  Defaults to {!Printf.eprintf} to go to
    the standard error. *)
