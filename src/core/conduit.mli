  (** {2:registration Protocol registration.} *)

  (** A flow is a system that allows entities to transmit {i payloads}. These
     entities do not have to care about the underlying transport mechanism.
     flows simply deal with routing and delivering of these payloads. That
     abstraction allows these protocols to compose.

      For example, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is representable as a
     flow, because it is able to encapsulate some {i payloads} without
     interpreting it. A counter-example is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
     (SMTP) which needs an interpretation of its {i payloads}: tokens such as
     [EHLO] or [QUIT] have a direct incidence over the life-cycle of the
     connection.

      An other protocol representable as a flow is the Transport Layer Security
     (TLS), as it deals only with privacy and data integrity. [Conduit] is able
     to compose flows together like [TCP âˆ˜ TLS] to make a new flow. Higher-level
     protocols can be built in top of these abstract flows: for instance, Secure
     Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SSMTP) or HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
     (HTTPS) can be defined on top of both TCP and TLS. Using [Conduit], these
     can be abstracted to work over any flow implementations. *)

  type ('edn, 'flow) protocol
  (** The type for client protocols. ['edn] is the type for endpoint parameters.
     ['flow] is the type for underlying flows.

      Endpoints allow users to create flows by either connecting directly to a
     remote server or by resolving domain names (with {!connect}). *)

  val register : protocol:('edn, 'flow) impl -> ('edn, 'flow) protocol
  (** [register ~protocol] is the protocol using the implementation [protocol].
     [protocol] must provide a [connect] function to allow client flows to be
     created.

      For instance, on Unix, [Conduit] clients will use [Unix.sockaddr] as flow
     endpoints, while [Unix.file_descr] would be used for the flow transport.

      {[
        module Conduit_tcp : sig
          val t : (Unix.sockaddr, Unix.file_descr) protocol
        end = struct
          let t = register ~protocol:(module TCP)
        end
      ]}

      Client endpoints can of course be more complex, for instance to hold TLS
     credentials, and [Conduit] allows all these kinds of flow to be used
     transparently:

      {[
        module Conduit_tcp_tls : sig
          val t : (Unix.sockaddr * Tls.Config.client, Unix.file_descr) protocol
        end = struct

      ]}

      As a protocol implementer, you must {i register} your implementation and
     expose the {i witness} of it. Then, users will be able to use it. *)

  (** {2 Injection and Extraction.}

      The goal of [Conduit] is to provide:
      {ul
      {- A way to manipulate a fully-abstract [flow].}
      {- A way to manipulate a concrete and well-know [flow].}}

      [Conduit] provides several mechanisms to be able to manipulate our abstract
     type {!flow} and destruct it to a concrete value such as a [Unix.file_descr].
     [Conduit] can assert one assumption: from a given abstracted [flow], it exists
     one and only one {!FLOW} implementation.

      As [Conduit] determines this implementation, the user can determine the used
     implementation when he wants to {!send} or {!recv} datas.

      So [Conduit] uses or extracts uniqely the implementation registered before
     with {!register} and no layer can tweak or update this assertion.

      {!repr}, {!flow}, {!impl} and {!is} can extracts in differents ways the
     abstracted {!flow}:
      {ul
      {- with the {i pattern-matching}}
      {- with {i first-class module}}
      {- with the function {!is}}}

  val repr : ('edn, 'v) protocol -> (module REPR with type t = ('edn, 'v) value)
  (** As a protocol implementer, you should expose the concrete type of your
     flow (to be able users to {i destruct} {!flow}). [repr] returns a module
     which contains extension of {!flow} from your [protocol] such as:

        module Conduit_tcp : sig
