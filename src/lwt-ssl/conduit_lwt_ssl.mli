(** Implementation of the SSL support (according [Lwt_ssl]) with [conduit-lwt].

    This implementation assumes that underlying protocol used to compose with
    SSL must deliver a [Lwt_unix.file_descr] - such as [Conduit_lwt.TCP]. From
    that, we are able to compose your protocol with [Lwt_ssl] such as:

    {[
      let ssl_protocol = protocol_with_ssl TCP.protocol

      let ssl_service =
        service_with_ssl TCP.service ~file_descr:TCP.file_descr ssl_protocol
    ]}

    Then, TCP + SSL is available as any others [conduit] protocols or services
    registered.

    {b NOTE}: [close] implementation properly closes an SSL connection with
    [Ssl.ssl_shutdown] AND properly closes the underlying file-descriptor by
    itself. From a given implementation of a protocol like [TCP], [TCP.close]
    will never be called by the SSL layer - but the file-descriptor will be
    closed.

    {b NOTE}: [verify] is called after a call to [flow] (which should do the
    [connect] call). So, nothing was exchanged between you and your peer at this
    time - even the handshake. It permits to fill the SSL socket with some
    information such as the hostname of the peer with
    [Ssl.set_client_SNI_hostname]. *)

  'edn ->
  ('edn, 'flow) endpoint
(** [endpoint ~file_descr ~context ?verify edn] returns an {i endpoint} needed
    to initialize a SSL connection from a [Lwt.file_descr]. Even if [endpoint]
    is abstracted over the type of the ['flow], we must be able to extract an
    [Lwt_unix.file_descr] from it.

    [verify] is the function called just after the initialization of the
    underlying ['flow]. It permits to request a verification such as the
    {i hostname} with your peer. *)

(** [service_with_ssl ~key service ~file_descr] returns a representation of the
    given service with SSL.

    [file_descr] is used to extract from the given ['flow] delivered by our
    service a [Lwt_unix.file_descr] needed to create a [Lwt_ssl.socket]. *)
