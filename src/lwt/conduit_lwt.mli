(** [io_of_flow flow] creates an input flow and an output flow according
   to [Lwt_io]. This function, even if it creates something more usable
   is {b deprecated}. Indeed, [Lwt_io] has its own way to schedule [read]
   and [write] - you should be aware about that more specially when you
   use [Conduit_tls] or [Conduit_lwt_ssl].

    Due to a specific behavior, [Lwt_io] does not fit with some specific
   protocols - non thread-safe protocols, {i send-first} protocols, etc.
   From these reasons, and even if {!TCP} try to the best to fit under
   an [Lwt_io], you should not use this function. *)

(** [serve ~handler ~service cfg] creates an usual infinite [service]
    loop from the given configuration ['cfg]. It returns the {i promise} to launch
    the loop and a condition variable to stop the loop.

    In your example, we want to launch a server only for 10 seconds. To help the user,
    the option [?timeout] allows us to wait less than [timeout] seconds. *)

      has reached {i end-of-input}. In other words, [recv] can do a multiple call
      to [Lwt_unix.recv] to fill the given buffer.

      {b NOTE}: [send] tries to send as much as it can the given buffer. However,
      if internal call of [Lwt_unix.send] returns something smaller than what we
      requested, we stop the process and return how many byte(s) we sended. In
      other word, [send] can do a multiple call to [Lwt_unix.send] until we fully
      sended what we wanted. *)
